  <h3 style="margin: 30px;"><u>Sukhoi Su-57</u></h3>
  <img src="./Su-57 Felon Fighter Russian Ministry of Defense photo.webp" width="650px" height="400px" style="margin: 30px;">
  <p style ="color:black;margin: 30px;"><b>Russia continues to innovate on its cutting-edge 5th generation fighter aircraft. It is expected to become the mainstay of its Aerospace Forces in future.</b></p>
  <p style="color: black;margin: 30px;">Russia's United Aircraft Corporation has published a patent for a Multifunctional two-seat stealth aircraft, which apears to be a variant of the fifth-generation heavy fighter, Su-57.
Russian media, which have a copy of the patent, report that the two-seat stealth tactical aircraft is designed to detect and destroy air, surface and ground targets.</p>
  <p style="color: black;margin: 30px;">The patent document states, "the invention relates to the field of aviation, namely to multifunctional two-seat stealth tactical aircraft, and is intended to detect and destroy air, surface and ground targets at super and subsonic flight speeds in a wide range of altitudes, as well as acting as an airborne command post for network-oriented actions of mixed groups of aircraft.</p>

  <h2 style="color:black;text-align: center;font-size: 55px;">Sukhoi Su-57</h2>
  <h3 style="color:black;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Design</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">The Su-57 is a fifth-generation multirole fighter aircraft and the first operational stealth aircraft for the Russian armed forces. In addition to stealth, the fighter emphasizes supermaneuverability in all aircraft axes, capacious internal payload bays for multirole versatility, and advanced sensor systems such as active phased-array radar as well as the integration of these systems to achieve high levels of automation
    <br>
    In the Su-57's design, Sukhoi cited the Lockheed Martin F-22 as the baseline for a supermaneuverable stealth fighter, but addressed what the bureau considered to be the limitations, such as the inability to use thrust vectoring to induce roll and yaw moments, a lack of space for weapons bays between the engines resulting in insufficient payload, and complications for post-stall recovery if thrust vectoring fails. In particular, Sukhoi considered the F-22 design unsuitable as a multirole fighter required for PAK FA due to the limited payload that was too focused on air-to-air missiles<br>
    The aircraft has a wide blended wing body fuselage with two widely spaced engines and has all-moving horizontal and vertical stabilisers, with the vertical stabilisers canted for stealth; the trapezoid wings have leading edge flaps, ailerons, and flaperons. The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and large leading edge root extensions that shift the aerodynamic center forward, increasing static instability and maneuverability. These extensions have adjustable leading–edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control the generated vortices and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails
    To air-brake, the ailerons deflect up while the flaperons deflect down and the vertical stabilisers toe inward to increase drag
    Although the majority of the structural materials are alloys with 40.5–44.5% aluminum alloys and 18.6% titanium alloys, the aircraft makes extensive use of composites, with the material comprising 22–26% of the structural weight and approximately 70% of the outer surface.<br>
    Designed from the outset as a multirole aircraft, the Su-57 has substantial internal payload capacity that allows the carriage of multiple large air-to-surface ordnance.
    Weapons are housed in two tandem main weapons bays in the large ventral volume between the widely spaced engine nacelles and smaller side bays with bulged triangular-section fairings near the wing root. Internal weapons carriage eliminates drag from external stores and enables higher performance compared to external carriage, as well as preserving the stealth shaping
    <br>The high degree of static instability (or relaxed stability) in both pitch and yaw, advanced KSU-50 flight control system, and canted thrust vectoring nozzles make the Su-57 departure-resistant and highly maneuverable in all axes and enables the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev's Cobra and the bell maneuver, along with doing flat rotations with little altitude loss.
    he aerodynamics and engines enable it to achieve speeds of Mach 2 and fly supersonic without afterburners, or supercruise, at Mach 1.3, giving a significant kinematic advantage and extends the effective range of missiles and bombs over previous generations of aircraft.
    Combined with a high fuel load, the fighter has a supersonic range of over 1,500 km (930 mi), more than twice that of the Su-27.
    An extendable refueling probe is available to further increase its range.

  <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align:center;font-size: 45px;">Stealth</h3>

  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">The first aircraft in Russian military service to emphasize stealth, the Su-57 employs a variety of methods to reduce its radar signature. Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the aircraft aligns the planform edges to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully angled to reduce the number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape, while radar absorbent material (RAM) coatings absorb radar emissions and reduce the reflection back to the source.
    <br>The infrared search-and-track sensor housing is turned backwards when not in use and its rear is also treated with RAM.
    To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the walls of the inlet ducts are coated with RAM and the partial serpentine ducts obscure most of the engines' compressor face and inlet guide-vanes (IGV); the remaining exposed engine face is masked by a slanted blocker grid placed in front of the IGV at a distance of 0.7—1.2 times the diameter of the duct, similar in principle to the method on the Boeing F/A-18E/F.<br>
    <br>The aircraft canopy is coated with 70–90 nm thick metal oxide layers with enhanced radar wave absorbing to reduce the radar return of the cockpit by 30% and protect the pilot from the impact of ultraviolet and thermal radiation.
    <br>The production tolerances are significantly tighter than previous Russian fighters in order to improve stealth characteristics.
    <br>The combined effect of airframe shape and RAM of the production aircraft is estimated to have reduced the aircraft's RCS to a value thirty times smaller than that of the Su-27.<br>
    Sukhoi's patent for the T-50 stealth features cites an intention to reduce average RCS to approximately 0.1 to 1 m2, compared to the Su-27's RCS of approximately 10 to 15 m<sup>2</sup>.
    The Su-57's design emphasizes frontal stealth, with RCS-reducing features most apparent in the forward hemisphere; the shaping of the aft fuselage is less optimized for radar stealth compared to American stealth designs such as the F-22 and F-35, likely as a result of cost reduction as well as the Russian doctrine of operating the aircraft within the umbrella of friendly integrated air defense systems.<br>
    s with other stealth fighters, the Su-57's low observability measures are chiefly effective against super-high-frequency (between 3 and 30 GHz) radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars, employed by weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the Su-57 due to its size. Such radars are also large, susceptible to clutter and are less precise.

  <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Engines</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">The Su-57 is powered by a pair of NPO Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117, or AL-41F1, augmented turbofans.[102] The engine is a highly improved and uprated variant of the AL-31 and produces 9 tonnes (88.3 kN, 19,840 lbf) of dry thrust, 14.5 tonnes (142.2 kN, 31,970 lbf) of thrust in afterburner, and 15 tonnes (147.1 kN, 33,070 lbf) of thrust in "special" emergency power. The engines have full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and are integrated into the flight control system to facilitate maneuverability and handling.
    The AL-41F1 is closely related to the Lyulka-Saturn izdeliye 117S engine, or AL-41F1S, used by the Su-35S, with the latter's separate engine control system being the key difference.<br>
    The aircraft employs thrust vector control (TVC) where the vectoring nozzles' rotational axes are each canted at an angle, similar to the nozzle arrangement first employed on the Su-30MKI and also used on Su-35S. The nozzles themselves vector in only one plane; the canting allows roll and yaw moments by vectoring each nozzle differentially, thus enabling the aircraft to produce thrust vectoring moments about all three aircraft axes, pitch, yaw and roll. The engine inlet incorporates variable intake ramps for supersonic efficiency and retractable mesh screens to prevent engine damage from foreign object debris ingestion especially when operating in short, austere runways.
    In 2014, the Indian Air Force openly expressed concerns over the reliability and performance of the AL-41F1; during the 2011 Moscow Air Show (MAKS-2011), a Su-57 suffered a compressor stall that forced the aircraft to abort takeoff.<br>
    The planned Su-57M will be equipped with a new engine from NPO Saturn in the mid-2020s under the development designation izdeliye 30 and eventually designated AL-51F-1. The powerplant is designed with an estimated thrust of 11 tonnes (107.9 kN, 24,300 lbf) dry and 17 tonnes (167 kN, 37,500 lbf) in afterburner. In addition to improved performance, reliability, and costs compared to the AL-41F1, the AL-51F-1 will also reduce the aircraft's radar and infrared signature with glass-fibre plastic IGVs and a new nozzle with serrated flaps.<br>
    In 2023, it was reported that UEC Saturn is planning a "sixth-generation" engine design for the Su-57. As of December 2023, all future Su-57 fighters delivered to the Russian Air Force by the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) will be powered by the advanced and more powerful Stage 2 engine, also called Izdeliye 30.

  <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Armament</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">The Su-57 has two tandem main internal weapon bays each approximately 4.4 m (14.4 ft) long and 0.9 m (3.0 ft) wide and two side weapon bays with triangular section fairings under the fuselage near the wing root.[109] The main bays have two types of ejection launchers made by Vympel, the UVKU-50L for missiles weighing up to 300 kg (660 lb), and the UVKU-50U for ordnance weighing up to 700 kg (1,500 lb); the side bays use the VPU-50 launch rails.<br>
    For air-to-air combat, the Su-57 carries four beyond-visual-range missiles in its two main weapons bays and two short-range missiles in the side bays
    The primary medium-range missile is the active radar-homing R-77M (izdeliye 180), an upgraded R-77 variant with AESA seeker, dual-pulse motor, and conventional rear fins.[113] The short-range missile is the infrared-homing ("heat seeking") R-74M2 (izdeliye 760), an upgraded R-74 variant with reduced cross-section for internal carriage.
    A clean-sheet design short-range missile designated K-MD (izdeliye 300) is being developed to eventually replace the R-74M2.For longer ranged applications, the Su-57 can carry the izdeliye 810 missile, a further development of the R-37M with shorter control surfaces and updated motor and seeker, with two in each main weapons bay; the R-37M could be carried externally.
    <br>
    For striking surface targets, the aircraft can carry the 250 kg (550 lb) KAB-250 or 500 kg (1,100 lb) KAB-500 precision guided bombs in its main bays. Internal weapons also include the Kh-38M air-to-ground missile, Kh-35U (AS-20 "Kayak") anti-ship missile, Kh-58UShK (AS-11 "Kilter") anti-radiation missile, and Kh-69 (originally designated Kh-59MK2) cruise missile.
    For missions that do not require stealth, the Su-57 can carry stores on its six external hardpoints which can use most Russian tactical fighter weapons. New hypersonic missile with characteristics similar to the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ALBM is also being developed for the Su-57. The missile is to have intra-body accommodation and smaller dimensions to allow it to be carried inside the Su-57's main bays.<br>
    The aircraft has a 9A1-4071K (GSh-30-1) 30 mm autocannon with 150 cartridges mounted internally near the right LEVCON root. The weapon has an effective range of 800 m (870 yd) against aerial targets and 1,800 m (2,000 yd) against surface targets.</p>


  <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Cockpit</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">The Su-57 has a glass cockpit with no analogue gauges; information is displayed on two 38 cm (15 in) main multi-functional LCD displays similar to the arrangement of the Su-35S. Supplementing the primary display is a smaller multi-functional display and digital control panel. The cockpit has a wide-angle (30° by 22°) head-up display (HUD). Primary controls are the joystick and a pair of throttles, with all major functions controlled with hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS).
    The aircraft uses a two-piece canopy, with the aft section sliding forward and locking into place. The canopy is treated with metallized coatings to reduce the aircraft's radar signature.[citation needed] The Su-57 integrated computer system at Chip "1890VM8Ya" — FGU FSC NIISI (in Russian).<br>
    The aircraft uses the NPP Zvezda K-36D-5 ejection seat and the SOZhE-50 life support system, which comprises the anti-g and oxygen generating system. The pilot is equipped with a ZSh-10B helmet which mounts the NSTsI-50 digital display system, which enhances pilot situational awareness through pupil tracking and allows engagement of targets at high angles off-boresight. The 30 kg (66 lb) oxygen generating system provides the pilot with unlimited oxygen supply.
    The life support system enables pilots to perform 9-g maneuvers for up to 30 seconds at a time, while the ejection seat and the new PPK-7 flight suit allows safe ejection at altitudes from 0 to 20,000 m (66,000 ft) and instrument airspeeds from 0 to 1,300 km/h (810 mph); the system also includes a survival kit to assist the pilot after ejection.

    <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Testing and trials</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">
    Even before the first flight of the T-50 prototype, several subsystems were tested on other aircraft for validation and risk reduction; an Su-27M was used to test the AL-41F1 engine on 21 January 2010, while another tested the KSU-50 flight control system.he T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010.he T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010.
    The T-50 prototype conducted its first high speed taxi run on 21 January 2010 and had its maiden flight several days later on 29 January 2010.
    First supersonic flight occurred on 14 March 2011 at a test range near Komsomolsk-on-Amur.<br>
    The Su-57 tests consisted of preliminary trials PI (Russian: ПИ, short for: Предварительные испытания) conducted by Sukhoi at the Gromov Flight Research Institute (LII, Russian: ЛИИ) at Zhukovsky, as well as two stages of joint state trials GSI (Russian: ГСИ, short for: Государственные совместные испытания) conducted by the Ministry of Defence at the 929th State Flight Test Centre (GLITs, Russian: ГЛИЦ) at Akhtubinsk.The completion of GSI-1 resulted in the acceptance of the aircraft's airworthiness, and the completion of GSI-2, which tests the mission systems and armaments, clears the Su-57 for operational service. The preliminary trials and state trials occurred with some overlap with each other.
    <br>Early flight tests revealed that the initial T-50 design had problems with structural strength and fatigue; when the first two prototypes were showcased publicly in MAKS-2011, the airframes cracked despite flying with a restrictive 5–g limit, which necessitated grounding and structural reinforcing for over a year as well as a "second stage" structural redesign.
    Of the ten flying and three non-flying T-50 prototypes, the three non-flying prototypes tested static flight loads, one each for "first stage" and "second stage" structures, and avionics integration. The first two flying prototypes tested flight characteristics and basic mechanical systems, and thus had no mission systems. Testing of mission systems such as the radar and electronic warfare suite began from the third prototype onwards, with each subsequent aircraft having slight variations in the arrangement of avionics and sensor systems.
    The final pre-production aircraft were equipped with full mission systems and tested the overall integrated avionics.
    <br>By February 2014, the first phase of preliminary trials, PI-1, had concluded;[N 9] in the same month, the 929th GLITs received its first T-50 at Akhtubinsk for further testing and GSI state trials.[154][155][156] However, severe issues were discovered during PI-1; in addition to the structural issues, the aircraft suffered from engine problems, including the AL-41F1 compressor stall during the MAKS-2011 airshow.
    In June 2014, the fifth prototype was severely damaged by an in-flight fire and written off, and an incomplete "first stage" airframe was finished using parts salvaged from the fifth prototype.
    Both preliminary and state trials were delayed by the fire and the structural redesign; the second phase of preliminary trials, PI-2, ran from 2014 to 2019 and mainly used structurally reinforced "first stage" aircraft while GSI-1 was halted until 2016 in order to wait for the updated "second stage" airframes. Armament trials were also delayed, with external weapon trials starting in May 2014 and internal trials starting in March 2016.
    GSI-1 was finished on 8 February 2018 with formal signing in May 2018.[160][61] After more than 3,500 flights, GSI-2 was planned to be completed by 2019, but this was pushed to 2020, partly because of the crash of the first production aircraft in December 2019.
    <br>As the Su-57 is gradually being inducted into Russian military service, Sukhoi is testing upgrades for the improved Su-57M variant. First flight of the izdeliye 30 engine occurred on 5 December 2017 with the second prototype (T-50-2, bort no. 052).
    Prototypes were also used for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) teaming tests with the Okhotnik UCAV, with a video of flight tests released by the Ministry of Defence on 27 September 2019.
    On 28 June 2020, TASS, with reference to anonymous sources within the military-industrial complex, reported that a 'swarm' teaming experiment had been conducted with a group of Su-35s and an Su-57 acting as a command and control aircraft. The networked information exchange significantly increases the efficiency of combat missions. Reportedly, the experiment was conducted in "real combat conditions".

  <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Other Versions</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">In 2008, UAC president Alexei Fedorov has said that any decision on applying fifth-generation technologies to produce a smaller fighter (comparable to the F-35) must wait until after the development of the PAK FA is completed.
    <br>A naval version of the Su-57 was proposed for the Project 23000E or Storm supercarrier. Models of the aircraft carrier project are showing Su-57 on board, with folding wings and stabilators. The Su-57 should be able to use the takeoff ramp as well as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System.[243] The draft of the future state armament program (GVP) for 2024–2033 includes the development of a new carrier-based fighter based on the Su-57, albeit with deep modifications.
    <br>The aircraft is used as a testbed for integration with UAVs as well as various subsystems (including weapon, control and navigation systems) being developed for Russia's future sixth-generation combat system, both in manned and unmanned version.
    In January 2019, it was reported the third flyable Su-57 prototype (bort. no 053) is being used for interaction with the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik UCAV, and testing of its avionics systems.
    <br>In July 2021, it was officially announced that a two-seater variant of the Su-57 was under development, to be used for training pilots and for ensuring the control of the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik UCAV. This variant was also mentioned at the Army-2022 forum in August 2022.

  <h3 style="color:black;margin: 30px;text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">Accidents</h3>
  <p style="color:black;margin: 30px;">On 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing. The pilot managed to escape unharmed. The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth "first stage" prototype, which was then given the fifth prototype's bort number and its designation changed from T-50-6-1 to T-50-5R. However, official accounting still considers the two aircraft to be the "same" one.<br>
    On 24 December 2019, the first serial Su-57 (bort number "01 blue") crashed 110–120 km away from the Dzyomgi Airport, Khabarovsk Krai, during the final stage of its factory trials due to a control system malfunction. The pilot ejected and was recovered by helicopter.<br>
    According to TASS, the test flight took place at an altitude of 8,000 meters when the malfunction occurred, causing the airplane to enter a rapid spiral descent. When all attempts to stabilize the airplane into a horizontal flight using the manual flight control system failed, the pilot ejected at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
